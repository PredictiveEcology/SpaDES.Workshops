# SpaDES Workshops

## Feb 7 - 9, 2018, Pacific Forestry Centre

If you are interested in being put on the email list for this or future courses, please email to eliot.mcintire at canada.ca

We have organized a set of sessions, back to back, starting from the most “general”, and ending with the most “detailed”. The hope is to attract non-modelers (e.g., managers, scientists, practitioners) to the first session, people who think they might want to see more how models work (e.g., scientists, students, technicians), and those who want to build and use models for research and operational purposes (e.g., scientists, technicians, programmers).

[**Please See Workshop Web Page**](http://spades-workshops.predictiveecology.org)

- **Intro** - 1.5 hours – **9 am Feb 7** - This is a high level intro for scientists, managers, policy makers, decision makers

- **Advanced Intro** - 4.5 hours – **11 am Feb 7** - This is intended to dive a little bit into the code, to allow people to run other models from other people, and allow them to change parameters.

- **Developers** - 3 days – **Feb 7 to Feb 9** - This 3 days workshop starts with the **Intro** and **Advanced Intro** above in the first day, and continues much deeper for developers of models. That means that if somebody who is interested in developing, but has already a good grasp on what SpaDES does and the higher level concepts, they can join in day 2.  ***See below for instructions***
