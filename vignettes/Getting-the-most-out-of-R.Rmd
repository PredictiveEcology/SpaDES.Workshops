## Need for speed

R is widely seen as being 'slow' (see [julia](http://julialang.org/#high-performance-jit-compiler) web page) 

**But**, if you use a few specific tools, then this becomes irrelevant because of the powerful tools in various packages in R
 
## An aside
 
Pure R, when the most efficient vectorized code is used, appears to be 1/2x the speed of the most efficient C++.

See Hadley Wickham's [page on Rcpp](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html), scroll down to "Vector input, vector output"... ), noting that if it took 10 minutes to write the C++ code, it would have to be 150,000 times faster to make it worth it.
 
## Need for speed

Spatial simulation means doing the same thing over and over and over ... so we need speed

We will show how to profile your code at the end of this section.

## "Vectorization"

- This is at the core of making R fast. If you don't do this, then it is probably not useful to use R as a simulation engine.

```{r vectorization}
# Instead of 
a <- vector()
for (i in 1:1000) {
  a[i] <- rnorm(1)
}

# use vectorized version, which is built into the functions
a <- rnorm(1000)
```

## Vectors and Matrices

- These are as fast as you can get in R
- Fast numerical operations
- Faster than `data.frame`
- Anything that is in pure vectors or matrices is 'fast enough'
- It is always a challenge to keep all code in vectors and matrices
- Thus the following packages...

## Spatial simulation

- To work with spatial simulation (*e.g.*, time and space), it requires more than *just* spatial data manipulation
- Sometimes it is just base R stuff
- Need to learn how to make functions (allows reusability)
- Need to learn a few key packages that are critical for speed

## Key packages for spatial simulation

- `base` package -- everything matrix or vector is 'fast'
- `raster` - for spatially referenced matrices

    - not always fast enough, sometimes we copy the data into a matrix, then manipulate, then return the data to the raster object
    
- `sp` - equivalent of vector shapefiles in a GIS

    - Polygons, Points, Lines
    - Not always fast, but essential to have

- see also `sf`

## Key packages for spatial simulation
    
- `data.table`

    - For `data.frame` type data (i.e., columns of data)
    - Very fast when object gets large, but is actually slower if the `data.frame` is small (<100,000 rows)
    
- `SpaDES` -- many functions; will be moved into a separate package soon

- `Rcpp`

    - R interface to C++ . When you need something fast, and you can't get it fast enough with existing tools/packages, you can create your own (we will not go further into this here)

## What we will do here

- We will go through `SpaDES` functions quickly, because there are fewer tutorials online for these
- We will show links to various tutorials for `raster`, `sp`, `data.table`, `Rcpp`
- Each person should decide which tool is the most useful to them
- Put something into practice

## `SpaDES` functions

- These are all potentially useful for building spatio-temporal models
```{r SpaDES functions}

?`spades-package` # section 2 shows many functions

# e.g.,
?spread
?move
?cir
?adj
?distanceFromEachPoint
```

## `sf`

- Relatively new
- Implements latest GIS data standards
- Very fast, especially reading/writing large data
- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/)

## The `data.table` package

From every `data.table` user ever:

<div class="centered" style="color:#0000FF">*WOW that's fast!*</div>

<br>

```{r install-data.table, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('data.table')
```

(at least for large tables!)

## `data.table` tutorials

- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-table-r-tutorial#gs.s=AE7o0)
- [Cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-table-cheat-sheet#gs.rFn247Q)

## `raster` and `data.table` together

- The current implementation of `LANDIS-SpaDES` uses a "reduced" data structure throughout

- Instead of keeping rasters of everything (one can imagine that there is redundancy, i.e., 2 pixels next to each other may be identical)

- We make one raster of "id" and one data.table with a column called "id"

- Then we can have as many columns as we want of information about each of these places

- Like "polygons", but for rasters, and dynamic... can change over time

- This may be useful for your own module

## `raster` and `data.table` together

- There is a key helper function:

```{r datatable and raster}
?rasterizeReduced
```

What does this do?

## The `Rcpp` package

From every `Rcpp` user ever:

<div class="centered" style="color:#0000FF">*WOW! Just wow.*</div>

<br>

```{r install-rcpp, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('Rcpp')
```

## Profiling and Benchmarking (1)

- In general, the usual claim is to worry about 'execution speed later'
- This is not 100% true with R
- If you use vectorization (no or few loops), and these packages listed here, then you will have a good start
- AFTER that, then you can use 2 great tools:

    - `profvis` package (built into the latest Rstudio previews, but not the official release version)
    - `microbenchmark` package

## Profiling and Benchmarking (2)

```{r microbenchmark, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  loop = {
    a <- vector()
    for (i in 1:1000) a[i] <- rnorm(1)
  },
  vectorized = { a <- rnorm(1000) }
)
```

## Profiling and Benchmarking (3)

If you have Rstudio version `>=0.99.1208`, then it has profiling as a menu item.

- alternatively, we wrap any block of code with `profvis`

- This can be a `spades()` call, so it will show you the entire model:

```{r profiling, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
profvis::profvis({a <- rnorm(10000000)})
```

## Profiling the `spades` call

Try it:

```{r profiling spades, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mySim <- simInit(
   times = list(start = 0.0, end = 2.0, timeunit = "year"),
   params = list(
     .globals = list(stackName = "landscape", burnStats = "nPixelsBurned")
   ),
   modules = list("randomLandscapes", "fireSpread", "caribouMovement"),
   paths = list(modulePath = system.file("sampleModules", package = "SpaDES"))
)
profvis::profvis({spades(mySim)})
```

## When to profile

- First, you should have started building your code with the packages we have discussed
- It will be too late if you have loops in your code, and you are ready to profile to improve it

If you have used these tools, then:

- When you have mostly finished whatever we are coding
- Don't ever start making code more efficient until you have profiled
- It is almost impossible to tell which bits are the slow parts, without profiling or benchmarking

## Strategies for profiling

- Can do an entire `SpaDES` model call
- Can pinpoint specific functions
- Can test alternative ways of implementing the same thing

## Next 

Building models with modules ...
