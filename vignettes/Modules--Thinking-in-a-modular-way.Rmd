## `SpaDES`

**Spa**tial **D**iscrete **E**vent **S**imulator

- [Discrete event simulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation) have a long history in computer science
- `SpaDES` is oriented around the construction of spatially explicit models and the use of **spatial** data.
- **events** describe *changes in the state of a complex system* at some *time*
- **time** is not modeled in a continuous fashion (simple loops would do this); we can 'skip ahead' to the next event, speeding up model evaluation
- events are scheduled (added to a queue) dynamically, and executed at their scheduled time

## Other DESs

- In Ecology, there are other generic DESs:

    - SELES (very generic)
    - HexSim
    - NetLogoR (Individual based models)
    
- More specific DESs

    - LANDIS (forest dynamics)

## Events

- Brainstorm events...


## Modules

- Modules are a *convenient* way to group events that fit naturally together:

    - *e.g.*, fire ignition module
    - *e.g.*, carbon accumulation module
    - *e.g.*, data preparation module
    
- What is contained in one module is highly idiosyncratic .

## Modules and Modularity

`SpaDES` is implemented in a way that facilitates *modularity* of code:
  
- different (ecological) processes can be grouped into logical units (*modules*)
- a(n) (ecological) model consists of a collection of modules
- each module is responsible for scheduling its own events
- modules interact *indirectly* via shared data objects (*e.g.*, a map);
module 'A' doesn't need to know what module 'B' is doing

**Thus, modules can be added, removed, or swapped out without needing to recode the rest of the model.**

## Module types

- There are many types of modules that may be useful:

    - Agents
    - Events
    - Data preparation
    - Summaries of data
    - see list from [SpaDES wiki](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide#types-of-modules)
    
Once we see that a module is just a convenient way to group together events, anything can be a module.
Can be a single line of code or as many as you want.

## Agent-based modules

- caribou
- [wolfAlps](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules/blob/master/modules/wolfAlps/wolfAlps.R)
- Mountain Pine Beetle

## Raster module

- Vegetation change
- Spatial clustering (*e.g.*, to create polygons)
- Aging
- Class change (*e.g.*, land cover class)
- Biomass change
- etc.

## Data preparation module

- cropReprojectLcc

## Why use a `SpaDES` module

... instead of just an R script or function?

- allows things to be scheduled
- allows modularity

    - a module can be reused by someone else with little change

- can be published on the web
- can estimate unknown parameters
- and much more...

## Anatomy of a module

A module is an **R script** with 3 parts:

1. **Metadata** - a list of 15 things

    - Name, Author, Description, other for human reader
    - parameters, input objects, output objects for R to "understand"
    
2. **doEvent** - 2 types of things here

    - schedule events
    - run functions
    
3. **Anything else**

    - custom functions
    - initial data preparation steps
    

## Running `SpaDES`

Essentially 2 steps

1. Create a `simList` using `simInit()`
2. Run `spades()`

All the necessary information is contained within the `simList`

What might be needed for a DES to run... 

## What is in the `simList`

    - start and stop times
    - data
    - paths
    - which modules to use
    - parameters
    - a schedule of events
    - outputs

- Will be covered in detail [next](The-simList.html)

## Data

- We are working with R, so we can use any data structure or file format that R can understand
- `SpaDES` has some helpers for loading data, but in general, the module should be explicit

    - *e.g.*, `downloadData("caribouMovementLcc", path = tempdir())`
    
- A module takes input data, changes them, and provides outputs
- like a function, but with the addition of "time"

- Some challenges ...

## Data challenges

Numerous challenges exist with data

- messy
- ownership
- large
- permissions
- errors
- other

`SpaDES` doesn't necessarily solve these issues, but in some cases it helps.

## Where to get help

- package help docs (*e.g.*, [overview of `SpaDES` package](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SpaDES/versions/1.2.0/topics/SpaDES-package)):

```{r help, eval=FALSE}
?SpaDES
```
