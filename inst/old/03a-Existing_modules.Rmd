# How to share modules

- We can share modules in any number of ways 

    - email
    - Cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
    - Version Control repository (e.g.,`SpaDES-Modules`)
    
## SpaDES-Modules GitHub repository

- We have created a repository on GitHub for this purpose (like *CRAN* for SpaDES modules)
- Of course, one can use any location, but we start here
- It is open for viewing, even submitting to (like *CRAN*) via (pull request for now)
- It is curated to some extent (like *CRAN*)

## Downloading modules

- There are several modules on SpaDES-Modules
- Several types (agent-based, raster, GIS, etc)
- We have several that are NOT hosted here, yet... 
- After publishing them, we will host them here.

## Types we will look at 

These are all simple, "toy" modules so far

- Spread module (fire)
- Agent-based modules (caribou, wolf)

## Modules not on SpaDES-Modules yet, waiting for publication

- Land-R_Biomass
- Land-R_BiomassClimate
- ECCC Caribou Population projection
- R-CBM (carbon budget model)

# Modules to download

## Downloading

- fireSpread
- caribouMovementLcc
- caribou2movements

### What does each do?

When you go to the next steps, try things out... ask some of these questions:

- Where do we start?
- Are there bugs?
- Are there visualizations?
- Is is complex, simple?
- What type of module is it?


*****

### Fire spread module

- Lets start with a simple spreading module

```{r}
library(SpaDES)
tmpdir <- file.path(dirname(tempdir()), "Modules")
downloadModule("fireSpreadLcc", path = tmpdir)
```

- Where is it? (where is tmpdir?)
- What does it look like?

*****

## Agent modules

### Download toy movement module

- Lets start with a simple movement module

```{r}
library(SpaDES)
tmpdir <- file.path(dirname(tempdir()), "Modules")
downloadModule("caribouMovementLcc", path = tmpdir)
```

### Wolf Alps & Caribou Gaspesie

- In SpaDES-Modules repository, 
- Two published movement modules 
- [Wolfs recolonizing the Alps](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules/blob/master/modules/wolfAlps/wolfAlps.html)
- [Caribou in GaspÃ©sie](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules/blob/master/modules/caribou2Movements/caribou2Movements.Rmd)

### Try one out

```{r}
downloadModule("caribou2Movements", path = tmpdir)
downloadModule("wolfAlps", path = tmpdir) # ignore warning about file size

# Can open the .Rmd (how to run it) or .R (module code)
file.edit(file.path(tmpdir, "caribou2Movements", "caribou2Movements.Rmd"))
file.edit(file.path(tmpdir, "wolfAlps", "wolfAlps.Rmd"))
```

- Can you get either to run?

### Debugging

- Lets do it...
- Go back to SpaDES wiki pages (how do I find it again...?)... Maybe Google search "R SpaDES wiki"
- [Remember the debugging tools](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/wiki/Debugging)
- `?spades` has new section on debugging that complements the above wiki

# Meta models

## Building *models* from *modules*

A model (as defined in the `SpaDES` world) consists of multiple interacting components (sub-models), which in the vocabulary of `SpaDES` we have been referring to as 'modules'

- One could imagine an example model:

    - caribou movement
    - vegetation dynamics
    - disturbance dynamics
    - data cleaning, downloading, etc.
    
- And we would give this ensemble of modules a name, like "LCC2005" (or maybe even a better name, but we will go with this)

## LCC2005

([Return to LCC2005 model](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules/blob/master/modules/LCC2005/LCC2005.html))

```{r exercise1}
library(igraph)
library(SpaDES)

setPaths(cachePath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/cache", 
         inputPath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/inputs", 
         modulePath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/modules", 
         outputPath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/outputs")

openModules("LCC2005", getPaths()$modulePath)
```

### Examine this module

What is different about it?

****

# Parent modules (a.k.a. module groups)

- Currently, only used to identify a group of modules
- Uses "childModules" list entry
- Currently, a parent module can not have any events or functions **only metadata** and **only childModules** is used
- This may be changed in the future, but most likely by simplifying the number of entries in the metadata

<br>

- Will this decision (by `SpaDES` developers) create problems?

<br>

- Can have grand-parents, great-grandparents, mixtures of parents, grand-parents etc.

## Module relationships

```{r relationship-diagram, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
library(igraph)
g <- data.frame(from = c("grandparentModule", "grandparentModule",
                         "parentModuleA", "parentModuleA",
                         "parentModuleB", "parentModuleB"),
                to = c("parentModuleA", "parentModuleB",
                       "childModuleA1", "childModuleA2",
                       "childModuleB1", "childModuleB2")) %>% 
  graph_from_data_frame()
plot(g, mark.groups = list(1:7, c(2,4,5), c(3,6,7)))

### NOT RENDERING IN THE WEBSITE!
```

## Module directory structure

```
moduleRepo/
  |_ childModuleA1/
  |_ childModuleA2/
  |_ childModuleB1/
  |_ childModuleB2/
  |_ grandparentModule/
  |_ parentModuleA/
  |_ parentModuleB/
```
## Running a parent module

If you restarted your R session, first prepare the global setup again:
```{r}
library(SpaDES)

# Remember, if you changed it in the previous step, keep it the same. Otherwise it won't find your modules!
setPaths(cachePath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/cache", 
         inputPath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/inputs", 
         modulePath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/modules", 
         outputPath = "~/temp_SpaDESws/outputs")
```

Then, prepare the simulation:

```{r run-lcc, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# setup simulation

times <- list(start = 2005.0, end = 2015.0, timeunit = "year")
parameters <- list(
  .globals = list(burnStats = "fireStats"),
  fireSpreadLcc = list(drought = 1.2),
  caribouMovementLcc = list(N = 1e3, startTime = times$start + 1, 
                            glmInitialTime = NA_real_)
)
modules <- list("LCC2005")
paths <- list(
  cachePath = getPaths()$cachePath,
  modulePath = getPaths()$modulePath,
  inputPath = getPaths()$inputPath,
  outputPath = getPaths()$outputPath
)
mySim <- simInit(modules = modules, paths = paths, params = parameters, times = times)
```

## Create a new parent module

The LCC2005 is a parent module that contains several children (What are they?).  Now make a new parent module from several of the LCC2005 modules, but without, say, fire.

```{r}
allButFire <- unlist(modules(mySim))[-6]
newModule("LCC2005NoFire", children = allButFire)
openModules("LCC2005NoFire", getPaths()$modulePath)
```

Go ahead and open the *LCC2005NoFire.R* and check the child modules in the metadata.

## Visual tools

There are a few tools that can help visualize the relationships between modules:

```{r visualize-sim, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# This next step will download data if they do not yet exist locally
lcc <- simInit(times = times, params = parameters,
               modules = modules, paths = paths)

objectDiagram(lcc)
moduleDiagram(lcc)
eventDiagram(lcc)

lcc <- spades(lcc)  ## compare the diagrams after running sim
```

### What do/would these do?

### Do they all work after `simInit`?

## Creating a new parent module

The `newModule` function creates a module template for you to edit to suit your needs:

```{r new-module, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
newModule('moduleName', file.path('path/to/my/module/directory'),
          type = 'parent', children = c('child1', 'child2'))
```

Alternatively, use the RStudio addin which is simply a GUI wrapper for this function (select 'parent' type):

## Parent modules

### A hypothetical example

The new **CFS-FD** model (Forest Dynamics Model)

- Has carbon, caribou, vegetation change, harvesting, climate, fire, insects
- But the vegetation module is actually a parent module with 3 modules:
    
    - mortality, growth, and regeneration modules

- fire module is actually 4 modules:
    
    - ignition, escape, spread, severity modules

## Parent modules

### Where to put code?

- Likely you can imagine that there would be code you would want to put in the parent module
- We had many discussions about this
- We concluded: 

<div class="centered" style="color:#0000FF">
*make a child module that does all the stuff you might think of as parent module content, add appropriate data dependencies*<br>
*(*i.e.*, outputs are required by the other modules as inputs)*
</div>

## Child modules

- Everything that we have talked about to date is a child module
- This means that it is a stand alone module

## Using metadata

- There are 15 items in the metadata header
- The header is defined withe the `SpaDES` function `defineModule`
- Usually at the top of the module script, but it doesn't have to be
- In the future, this will likely expand, and gain functionality to allow increased automation

```{r define module}
# What are the 15 items?
```

- Explore different options

## Metadata

- Is there anything missing from the 15 items?
