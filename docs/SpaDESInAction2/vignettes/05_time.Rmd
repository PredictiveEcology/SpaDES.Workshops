knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We need to define the start and end of the simulation. It is important to pass it as a `list`. By default, a simulation uses the finest time scale of all modules, unless it is specified in the `timesunits` of the initialization function as:  

`simInit(times = list(start = 0, end = 10, timeunits = "months"`  

In this case, the default is overridden manually. We will discuss the initialization done by `simInit()` in section `9. SimInit and the simList`. For now, we will leave it for SpaDES to determine the time scale.

```{r time}
times <- list(start = 0, end = 20)
```
