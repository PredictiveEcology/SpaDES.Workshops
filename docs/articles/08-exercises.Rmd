# `shine`

1. Explore the `LCC2005` (or your working parent module) using the `shine` function:

    ```{r shine}
    shine(lcc05)
    ```

Before you can add your newly created module to a `SpaDES` module repository, you must ensure it is complete!

1. Review the [module development checklist](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide#module-development-checklist), and update your parent module and all children accordingly.
