  - title: "What is SpaDES?"
    desc: >
      A high-level introduction to the SpaDES framework that can help with reproducible, reusable research.
    contents:
    - SpaDES-as-a-tool-for-transparent-decision-making-in-ecology

  - title: "SpaDES as a simulation platform"
    desc: >
      Here we look at an existing simulation model, LandR-Biomass --> This one is a rewrite of LANDIS-II Biomass Succession
    contents:
    - Vegetation-Simulation-Model

  - title: "SpaDES as a workflow platform"
    desc: >
      Here we continue with LandR-Biomass --> But we add a module that estimates all parameters and gets all data.
      The module, Biomass_borealDataPrep, has been tested widely in the boreal forest of Canada.
      It  uses open datasets.

  - title: "Hands on: From R to SpaDES"
    desc: >
      In this section we will present examples of how to bring both static and dynamic R scripts into SpaDES, by creating modules from scratch and linking them

  - title: "SpaDES as a workflow platform"
    desc: >
      Here we look at a few other examples located on the SpaDES-modules repository: https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules


      Single workflows need to resolve several things:
      1. Libraries and options
      2. Project structure
      3. Setting Paths
      4. Get data
      5. Time
      6. Modules
      7. Parameters
      8. Objects
      9. SimInit, the simList and the `spades()` call
      10. Checking your outputs

  - title: "SpaDES as an integration platform"
    desc: >
      What is one way to conceive of integration:
      1. Get data
      2. Libraries and options
      3. Project structure
      4. Setting Paths
      5. Time
      6. Modules
      7. Parameters
      8. Objects
      9. SimInit, the simList and the `spades()` call
      10. Checking your outputs

  - title: "Day 1 - Section 3: SpaDES in Action: a forest succession, a wildfire models, and a caribou models -- putting it all together"
    desc: >
      Here we present two models that we use for forest succession (`LandR`) and wildfire (`SCFM`).
      This is an example of module integration using SpaDES

  - title: "Day 2 - Section 4: Basic concepts to get you started"
    desc: |
      Now we will use the SpaDESinAction example to understand how SpaDES works. These are the topics we will cover:
      1. Global script
      2. Libraries and options
      3. Project structure
      4. Setting Paths
      5. Time
      6. Modules
      7. Parameters
      8. Objects
      9. SimInit, the simList and the `spades()` call
      10. Checking your outputs

  - title: "Day 2 - Section 6: Is it taking too long? Is it not working? The miracles of caching and debugging"
    desc: >
      In this section we will explain how to use a caching  mechanism in SpaDES and how to debug your code when something errors
