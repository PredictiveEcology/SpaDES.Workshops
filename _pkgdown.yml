    desc: >
      Here we present some of the projects that used SpaDES and its tools

  - title: "Day 1 - Section 3: SpaDES in Action: a forest succession, a wildfire models, and a caribou models -- putting it all together"
    desc: >
      Here we present two models that we use for forest succession (`LandR`) and wildfire (`SCFM`).
      This is an example of module integration using SpaDES

      Now we will use the SpaDESinAction example to understand how SpaDES works. These are the topics we will cover:
      1. Global script
      2. Libraries and options
      3. Project structure
      4. Setting Paths
      5. Time
      6. Modules
      7. Parameters
      8. Objects
      9. SimInit, the simList and the `spades()` call
      10. Checking your outputs
